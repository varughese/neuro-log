This is a project designed to help psychologists keep better track of their patients and increase efficiency. On the patient side, a person writes diary logs about how they are doing. This is kept in a database, and analysed for the tone using Watson Blue Mix. Some simple analytics are preformed, and the information is displayed to the psychologist in the form of a percents of each emotion in the passage, a chart of recent activity, and a warning if the patient may need extra attention.
